The goal of **equatiomatic** is to reduce the pain associated with writing LaTeX
code from a fitted model. In the future, the package will support any model
supported by [**broom**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=broom); so far it
has only been tested with `lm` and `glm` models.


## Installation

equatiomatic is not yet on CRAN. Install the dev version from GitHub with

``` r
remotes::install_github("datalorax/equatiomatic")
```

## Examples

![](man/figures/equatiomatic.gif)

The gif above shows the basic functionality. 

In non-gif form: 

```{r example1}
library(equatiomatic)

# Fit a simple model
mod1 <- lm(mpg ~ cyl + disp, mtcars)

# Give the results to extract_eq
extract_eq(mod1)
```

Including the above in an R Markdown document with `results = "asis"` will
render the equation to look like the below.

![](man/figures/eq1.png)

Alternatively, you can run the code interactively, copy/paste the equation to
where you want it in your doc, and make any edits you'd like. There is also the
optional `preview` argument that will allow you to see what the equations look
like before you have them rendered.

```{r example-preview, eval = FALSE}
extract_eq(mod1, preview = TRUE)
```

and it will show up in your RStudio view pane like below.

![](man/figures/preview.png)

You can also request it return the actual coefficients

```{r use_coefs}
extract_eq(mod1, use_coefs = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/eq2.png)

It can also handle shortcut syntax. 

```{r example2}
mod2 <- lm(mpg ~ ., mtcars)
extract_eq(mod2)
```

![](man/figures/eq3.png)

For categorical variables, it will place the levels of the variables as
subscripts.

```{r example3}
mod3 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width + Species, iris)
extract_eq(mod3)
```

![](man/figures/eq4.png)

It preserves the order the variables are supplied in the formula.

```{r example4}
set.seed(8675309)
d <- data.frame(cat1 = rep(letters[1:3], 100),
               cat2 = rep(LETTERS[1:3], each = 100),
               cont1 = rnorm(300, 100, 1),
               cont2 = rnorm(300, 50, 5),
               out   = rnorm(300, 10, 0.5))
mod4 <- lm(out ~ cont1 + cat2 + cont2 + cat1, d)
extract_eq(mod4)
```

![](man/figures/eq5.png)


You can wrap the equations at a specified width, which defaults to 80.

```{r example5}
extract_eq(mod4, wrap = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/eq6.png)


And you can optionally have the variables themselves be italicized.

```{r example6}
extract_eq(mod4, wrap = TRUE, width = 100, ital_vars = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/eq7.png)

You're not limited to just `lm` models! You should be able to use any model
supported by [**broom**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=broom), like
logistic regression with `glm()`:

```{r example7}
set.seed(8675309)
d <- data.frame(out = sample(0:1, 100, replace = TRUE),
                cat1 = rep(letters[1:3], 100),
                cat2 = rep(LETTERS[1:3], each = 100),
                cont1 = rnorm(300, 100, 1),
                cont2 = rnorm(300, 50, 5))
mod5 <- glm(out ~ ., data = d, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
extract_eq(mod5, wrap = TRUE)
```

## Extension

This project is brand new. If you would like to contribute, we'd love your help!
We are particularly interested in extending to more models. At present, we have
only tested `lm` and `glm`, but hope to support any model supported by
[**broom**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=broom) in the future.

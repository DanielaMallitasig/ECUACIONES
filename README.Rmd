# equatiomatic

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/datalorax/equatiomatic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/datalorax/equatiomatic)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of equatiomatic is to reduce the pain associated with writing LaTex 
code from a fitted model. At present, only `lm` models are handled, but the 
hope is to expand to a greater number of models in the future.

## Installation

equatiomatic is not yet on CRAN. Install the dev version from GitHub with

``` r
remotes::install_github("datalorax/equatiomatic")
```

## Examples
Below are a few simple examples of how to use the package. 


```{r example1}
library(equatiomatic)
# Fit a simple model
mod1 <- lm(mpg ~ cyl + disp, mtcars)
# Give the results to extract_eq_lm
extract_eq_lm(mod1)
```

Including the above in an R Markdown document with `results = "asis"` will
render the equation to look like the below.

Alternatively, you can run the code interactively, copy/paste the equation to
where you want it in your doc, and make any edits you'd like. 

There is also the optional `preview` argument that will allow you to see what the equations look
like before you have them rendered.

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(texPreview)
tex_opts$set(returnType='html')
```

```{r example-preview,out.width = "25%"}
extract_eq_lm(mod1, preview = TRUE)
```

It can also handle shortcut syntax. 

```{r example2}
mod2 <- lm(mpg ~ ., mtcars)
extract_eq_lm(mod2)
```

For categorical it will place the levels for the coefficients as subscripts

```{r example3}
mod3 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width + Species, iris)
extract_eq_lm(mod3)
```

And it preserves the order the variables are supplied in

```{r example4}
set.seed(8675309)
d <- data.frame(cat1 = rep(letters[1:3], 100),
               cat2 = rep(LETTERS[1:3], each = 100),
               cont1 = rnorm(300, 100, 1),
               cont2 = rnorm(300, 50, 5),
               out   = rnorm(300, 10, 0.5))
mod4 <- lm(out ~ cont1 + cat2 + cont2 + cat1, d)
extract_eq_lm(mod4)
```

## Extension
This project is brand new. If you would like to contribute, we'd love your help!
We are particularly interested in extending to more models. At present, we have
only implemented `lm`, but hope to change that in the near future. Stay tuned!
